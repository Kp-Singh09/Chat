-   **Message Receipts:** Sent messages display ticks (‚úì) which turn blue (‚úì‚úì) when the recipient has read them.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** React Native, Expo, TypeScript, Expo Router, React Native Paper, Socket.IO Client, Axios
-   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO, MongoDB, Mongoose
-   **Authentication:** JWT, bcrypt.js

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these instructions to get the project running locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)

### Backend (`/server`)

1.  **Navigate to the server directory:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `/server` directory and add the following variables.
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_and_long_key
    ```
4.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:3001`.

### Frontend (`/mobile`)

1.  **Navigate to the mobile directory:**
    ```bash
    cd mobile
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Update the API URL:**
    This is a crucial step. In all files that define the `API_URL` constant (e.g., `login.tsx`, `index.tsx`, `chat/[id].tsx`), you **must** replace the placeholder IP address with your computer's local network IP address.
    
    * **Windows:** Run `ipconfig` in Command Prompt.
    * **Mac/Linux:** Run `ifconfig` in the terminal.
    
    Example: `const API_URL = 'http://192.168.1.10:3001';`

4.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app or run on an emulator. For best results, use a development build as created during the tutorial.
